🛣️ Roadside Object Detection using YOLO – Saudi Arabia Hackathon Project

📌 Overview

This project was developed as part of a Hackathon in Saudi Arabia, focusing on enhancing road safety and improving urban infrastructure. Using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model, we performed real-time detection and classification of roadside anomalies that can lead to accidents or public inconvenience.

🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to reduce traffic accidents and improve public infrastructure maintenance by detecting and classifying hazardous roadside elements. Our AI-powered solution aims to assist municipalities and urban planners in identifying and resolving infrastructure issues proactively.

🧠 Technology Stack
	•	Model Used: YOLO (You Only Look Once) – for real-time object detection
	•	Frameworks: Python, OpenCV, PyTorch (or TensorFlow, if applicable)
	•	Dataset: Curated images from Saudi Arabia’s roads, labeled across 11 unique classes

🗂️ Detected Classes

We classified the detected objects into the following 11 categories:
	1.	Graffiti
	2.	Faded Signage
	3.	Potholes
	4.	Garbage
	5.	Construction on Road
	6.	Broken Signage
	7.	Bad Streetlight
	8.	Bad Billboard
	9.	Sand on Road
	10.	Cluttered Sidewalk
	11.	Unkept Facade

⚙️ Key Features
	•	Real-time object detection with high accuracy
	•	Class-wise identification for actionable insights
	•	Scalable pipeline for further integration with traffic systems or government apps

🌍 Social & Practical Impact
	•	Accident Prevention: Timely identification of potholes, bad lighting, or construction zones can help reduce the likelihood of road accidents.
	•	Urban Cleanliness: Detection of garbage or graffiti allows for better maintenance of public spaces.
	•	Smart Cities: Contributes to the vision of smart city infrastructure by automating issue detection.
