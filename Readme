🛣️ Roadside Object Detection using YOLO

📌 Overview

This project focuses on enhancing road safety and improving urban infrastructure through AI-powered object detection. By leveraging the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, the system performs real-time detection and classification of various roadside anomalies that may contribute to accidents or public inconvenience.

🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to reduce road-related hazards and assist in the timely maintenance of public infrastructure by identifying and categorizing potentially dangerous roadside elements. The solution is designed to support municipalities and urban planning bodies in proactive decision-making.

🧠 Technology Stack
	•	Model: YOLO (You Only Look Once) – for real-time object detection
	•	Frameworks: Python, OpenCV, PyTorch (or TensorFlow, if applicable)
	•	Dataset: Custom-labeled images covering diverse roadside conditions across 11 distinct classes

🗂️ Detected Classes

The model detects and classifies the following 11 categories:
	1.	Graffiti
	2.	Faded Signage
	3.	Potholes
	4.	Garbage
	5.	Construction on Road
	6.	Broken Signage
	7.	Bad Streetlight
	8.	Bad Billboard
	9.	Sand on Road
	10.	Cluttered Sidewalk
	11.	Unkept Facade

⚙️ Key Features
	•	Real-time object detection with high precision
	•	Multi-class classification for actionable insights
	•	Modular and scalable architecture for integration with smart traffic systems or urban monitoring tools

🌍 Social & Practical Impact
	•	Accident Prevention: Early detection of hazards like potholes or poor lighting can help reduce road accidents.
	•	Cleaner Cities: Identifying garbage, graffiti, and clutter supports better maintenance.
	•	Smart Infrastructure: Enables automated monitoring systems for smart cities.
